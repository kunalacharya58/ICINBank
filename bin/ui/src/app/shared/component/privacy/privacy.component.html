When you visit this web site ICIN Bank may collect personal information about you, either directly (where you are asked to provide the information) or indirectly. While information is the cornerstone of our ability to provide superior service, our most important asset is our customers' trust. Keeping customer information secure, and using it only as our customers would want us to, is a top priority for all of us at ICIN Bank. Hence, ICIN Bank will only use these personal data in accordance with the purposes set forth in this Privacy Statement and is committed to safeguarding the personal information collected. Here then, is our promise to our individual customers:

    <ul>
        <li>
            We will safeguard, according to strict standards of security and confidentiality, any information our customers share with us.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            We will limit the collection and use of customer information to the minimum required to deliver superior service to our customers, which includes advising our customers about our products, services and other opportunities, and to administer our business.

        </li><br>

        <li>
            We will permit only authorized employees, who are trained in the proper handling of customer information, to have access to that information. Employees who violate our Privacy Promise will be subject to our normal disciplinary process.

        </li><br>

        <li>
           We will not reveal customer information to any external organization unless we have previously informed the customer in disclosures or agreements, or authorized by the customer, or are required by law. ICIN Bank disclaims any liability arising from use or disclosure of information to any external organization.


        </li><br>

        <li>
            Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services, we will require them to conform to our policy standards and to allow us to audit them for compliance.

        </li><br>

        <li>
           We will not use or share - internally or externally - personally identifiable medical information for any purpose other than the underwriting or administration of a customer's policy, claim or account, or as disclosed to the customer when the information is collected, or to which the customer consents.


        </li><br>

        <li>
            We will attempt to keep customer files complete, up to date, and accurate. We will inform customers how and where to conveniently access their account information (except when we are prohibited by law), and how to notify us about errors which we will promptly correct.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            We will continuously assess ourselves to ensure that customer privacy is respected.
        </li><br>
